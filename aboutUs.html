<h3>John Doe was a poor boy who grew up in the suburbs of Wisconshin,<br>
he had a abusive familly and was getting beat up everyday.Because of this,<br>
and also cause he was not gangster enough to join some local gang,<br>
he spent most of his time in the town's library where he had his ever first <br>
interaction with this magic machine called the computer.<br><br>
Years later he was studying at the Washington University the subject of computer sciences ,<br>
here he developed FakeBook alone.
